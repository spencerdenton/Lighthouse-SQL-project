# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My first SQL Project. The primary goal of this project is to apply the various SQL and data analysis skills I have learned in week one of the LHL Data Science Bootcamp to this dataset. 

## Process
### Identify data we have to work with
I reviewed the CSV files in Excel to familiaarize myself with the data.
I louded the CSV files into the database.
I cleaned data to make it more usable and readable. 
I then analysed  data to get useful insight into the situation of the business website and determine both answers to the existing questions and determined new questions to ask.
I quality checked things. 
I then transformed the data into a ERD.

## Results
From the data I was able to see what producs were be being purchased, where these purchases were coming from, the types of products being purchased, the number of products being purchased, the revenue being generated, the number of transactions being processed, who was visiting the site, how long and how many pages they were looking at and if there was any insightful patterns that could be determined. This data was used to run a series of queries to answer the various questions contained in the subsequent files. 

## Challenges 
There was insuiffiecnt data to work with (eg. 80 transactions). It was hard to see patterns and get useful results from the limited data available. Poor instruction leading up to the first project also made it challenging. 

## Future Goals
Further analysis data to draw more meaning from the data set. Try to determine why the conversion rate is so low and have the webiste make tweaks and get new data sop we can see if the changes are having the desired effects.
