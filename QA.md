What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

Missing values, duplicate values and incorrect values. Also cleaning and changing tables incorrectly. All of these could massively skew the data analysis and return inaccurate results. 

QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

Looked for NULL values and duplicates. Counted rows to ensure things matched. Used COUNT and GROUP and JOIN Queries. 


1: Check that sales_report.total_ordered  =  sales_by_sku.total_ordered 
    use sales_by_sku.total_ordered as the primary key

    --first, check for duplicated SKUs in each
        SELECT product_sku, count(*)
            from sales_report
        GROUP BY product_sku
        ORDER by count DESC

    --no duplicated SKUs, so use SKU as primary key to check that the ordered amounts in both tables are the same
        SELECT sbs.product_sku AS sbs_sku, 
            sr.product_sku AS sr_sku,
            sbs.total_ordered AS sbs_total_ordered, 
            sr.total_ordered AS sr_total_ordered,
            sbs.total_ordered - sr_total_ordered as comparison
        from sales_by_sku sbs
        JOIN sales_report sr
        ON sbs.product_sku = sr.product_sku
        ORDER BY comparison DESC

    --nothing >0, so total_ordered matches for each SKU in each table

2: Does the product_quantity or product_revenue from the sessions table bear any relation to the sales_by_sku or the sales_report tables?

        SELECT SUM(product_quantity)
            FROM sessions
    --answer = 189
    --this is obviously far lower than the quantities represented in the sales_by_sku and sales_report
        SELECT SUM(total_ordered)
            FROM sales_by_sku
        SELECT SUM(total_ordered)
            FROM sales_report
    --answers are 5524 and 5519 (why are these not the same? Maybe one SKU is represented in one table but not the other?
